# About Support SF Schools

Hello! Thanks for checking out Support SF Schools. We started this project in summer 2022 to solve a big problem in San Francisco. Schools need help. And people who live or work in SF want to support local schools, but they donâ€™t know how. We are building a [website](https://supportsfschools.org/) to help solve that.

# Mapbox

You need to sign up for Mapbox to run the project locally.

1. Goto https://www.mapbox.com and sign up

2. It will ask you for billing information, but it is pay as you go. You have 500 instances before you are charged.

# Prisma

We're using Prisma as our ORM. If you're unsure of what it is or what it does here is a [link](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/introduction/what-is-prisma#how-does-prisma-orm-work) to the prisma documentation regarding how it works and why its used

### Model changes

[Prisma documentation on prototyping schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/prototyping-your-schema)

- If you want to make changes to any model in prisma, the schema file within the prisma folder is where those changes will take place
- Once you have made the changes to a model you're going to run this command in your terminal

  - The CLI will ask if you want to continue knowing that you will lose data, because we are seeding data and there is no user changes being made to our data this is completely acceptable

  ```sh
     npx prisma db push
  ```

- This will execute the changes required to make the vercel postgres database schema reflect the state of our prisma schema

### Seeding

- After running `npx prisma db push` we lose all the data so we need to seed our database with all the school information, run this command in your terminal after making changes to the model

  - it should be noted that if you're making changes to the model the seed script will also need to be updated to account for the new fields that were added

  ```sh
     npx prisma db seed
  ```

# Environment File

Create an environment file to pass your default public token from Mapbox and connect Prisma to postgres

1. Create the local server env file in the main directory (with the README.md file):

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your default public token to your `.env`

   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_default_public_token
   ```

3. For the prisma configuration you're going to need the vercel postgres URLs. For security, please ask an existing developer for this information. Add both of these to your `.env` file. Alternatively, you can [follow these instructions](docker/README.md) to set up a local Postgres instance in a Docker container.
   ```sh
   POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=ask_a_dev
   POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=ask_a_dev
   ```

# Get Started

To run this project locally, please perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sfbrigade/support-sfusd.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies at the root directory

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result

   - Alternatively, you can open [http://[LAN_IP]:3000](http://[LAN_IP]:3000) on another device, such as a phone on the same network. Replace `LAN_IP` with the IP address of your development server, which can be found inside of the "LAN url" part of the `npm run dev` log.

## Gotchas

For Tailwind CSS, do not use `h-screen` as it is broken on mobile Safari. Instead, use our custom class `h-dvh-with-fallback` until which time the official `h-dvh` alone suffices (fallbacks are not needed).
