# About Support SFUSD

Hello! Thanks for checking out Support SFUSD. We started this project in summer 2022 to solve a big problem in San Francisco. Schools need help. And people who live or work in SF want to support local schools, but they donâ€™t know how. We are building a [website](https://support-sfusd.vercel.app/) to help solve that.
