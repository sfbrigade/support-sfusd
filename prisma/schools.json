These critical funds directly support every student at Argonne and pays for additional supplies, staff, and programs. All these enrichment opportunities would be lost without the money we raise during the Annual Giving Campaign.\n\nThank you for your support and generosity!",
    "testimonial": "\"I currently have 2 kids at Argonne with an incoming Kindergartener in a few years. We couldn't be happier to be at Argonne. The kids are thriving and love going to school. The community is warm and inviting with really strong parent/caregiver involvement. Also, having the kids start the school year in July with summer session is great - we don't have to worry about summer camps AND they get to do so many more field trips and fun activities throughout the year.\"",

I haven't witnessed any bullying as the previous reviews mentioned but I have heard that there was something going on when the kids first came back from the pandemic. As far as I can tell, the school is very safe and the kids are very nice (and parents). There are lots of performances that are open to the parents and the PTA is active in creating events for all families. This is the kind of school where things feel organized and professional. It's a good learning environment for kids. There is a large friendly group of parents who live near the school but lots of us live in the Excelsior or Bayview, too. We're really happy to be here.",

Not just any kind of staff, but teachers that have 5-22 years of experience. They are the kind of teachers that willing give all that they have to help our children. My son is in 1st grade and from kindergarten 1st day (a little shy and scared), when we picked him up after school he already asked if he could stay or come back the next day. This put our minds and heart a ease. \n3. The dedication from everyone else; principal, staff to PTA, is admirable.\n4. Helping not just students but the community.\n\nDon't expect perfection, nothing is perfect. Kids fall down, they lose their jackets, and have difficulties adjusting.\n\nTrust the school to do everything they can to keep our kids safe and to teach them to be the best they can be.\n\nPlease remember the school still needs your help and participation. There are many community events that welcome parents and family. ",

    "testimonial": "The first thing you see about the school is the building: it’s a beautiful, modern space. I wish I had gone to school in a building that nice. it’s bright, spacious, with top notch athletic facilities, there are also tons of creative and tech spaces. This is the type of environment that makes you want to learn. That being said, a building giving a startup vibe counts for nothing, if the rest wasn’t following. I had read the past reviews and was worried about academics and the atmosphere in the school, especially during the hard years of middle school. My worries vanished one by one talking to parents, students and staff. But what convinced me immediately was the open house event, where anyone could visit the school and see the space and students projects. I saw a bunch of diverse 8th grader giving presentations about their work (robotics for instance), and most importantly answering questions. These students were eloquent, passionate, at ease both with the subject and addressing grown ups. I decided to enroll my kids. During the pandemic students received a top-notch tablet and data plan from Verizon, they have been well taken care of during those tough social distancing times.",
